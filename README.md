# Data-Structures
The purpose of this repository is to help other programmers learn some of the most important and common Data Structures.

## Introduction
Although these are just examples, it should give a clear understanding of how these data structures work. If you are still having trouble, please use Python Debugger (PDB) which will run through the code line by line to help you understand what exactly is going on.

Each of the files within this repo are written in my own way. It is possible that these scripts can be made better, however the goal is to help others understand and have examples of these Data Structures, and my goal is by no means to have them be perfect. 

## Disclaimer
Resources from StackOverflow have been referenced in some of these scripts.
